# BookstoreProjectBackend
A project for managing a book store. 

This repository deals with the backend side of things.
The technologies that I am using are as follows:

              -> Java
              -> IntelliJ IDEA
              -> SpringBoot
              -> Spring Data JPA
              -> Spring Security
              -> Spring Mail
              -> Lombok
              -> MySQL
            
I am also using Postman to test my API's and the service of Mailtrap.io as my fake email provider.
